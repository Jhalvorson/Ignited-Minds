# Ignited-Minds
Turning your burning ideas into a reality. Ignited Minds is a web app built on Ruby on Rails that filters and congregates all of the relevant events, funding, inspiration, like-minded people and missions that will help turn your burning idea into a reality.

This is the basic front-end of the entire project. It's built with the Bootstrap framework and contains the files for both the marketing website/blog and the app.
